Introduction
Extracting relevant data from datasets is crucial in data science. In this project, we focus on stock data and demonstrate how to extract it using various methods. Additionally, we visualize the data to aid decision-making.

Setup
Before running the code, ensure you have the necessary libraries installed. You can use pip install -r requirements.txt to install the required packages.

Questions
Question 1: Using yfinance to Extract Stock Data
We use the yfinance library to extract historical stock data. The code for this task is provided in the notebook.

Question 2: Webscraping for Tesla Revenue Data
Webscraping allows us to extract financial data from websites. We demonstrate how to scrape Tesla’s revenue data from a specific source.

Question 3: Using yfinance for Stock Data
Continuing from Question 1, we explore additional features of yfinance for stock data extraction.

Question 4: Webscraping for GME Revenue Data
Similar to Tesla, we extract revenue data for GameStop (GME) using webscraping techniques.

Question 5: Plotting Tesla Stock Graph
We create a graphical representation of Tesla’s stock data using Python’s plotting libraries.

Question 6: Plotting GameStop Stock Graph
Similarly, we visualize GameStop’s stock data.
